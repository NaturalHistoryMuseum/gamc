## Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen

Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) is a data standard which aims to
describe four different levels of digitization status for biological and geological
specimens from natural history collections, each level requiring certain information
elements to be digitally available.
With this standard, users of collection data, as well as funders and collection curators
will have a better overview of how comprehensively digitized a collection or any other
set of specimens really is.
The standard is currently still under development by a Task Group of the global
Biodiversity Information Standards (“TDWG”) organization.
All MIDS levels are fairly stable, but they are still under discussion and have yet to
be ratified by TDWG into the first version of the MIDS standard.
For more details, see https://github.com/tdwg/mids.
